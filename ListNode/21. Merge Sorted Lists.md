```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def mergeTwoLists(list1, list2):
    dummy = ListNode()
    tail = dummy

    while list1 and list2:
        if list1.val < list2.val:
            tail.next = list1
            list1 = list1.next
        else:
            tail.next = list2
            list2 = list2.next
        tail = tail.next

    tail.next = list1 or list2
    return dummy.next

```

**Time Complexity: `O(n + m)`**

Where:

- `n` = length of `list1`

- `m` = length of `list2`

### Why?

You traverse **every node exactly once** from both lists.  
There are no nested loops â€” just a single pass combining both.

---

 **Space Complexity: `O(1)`**

### Why?

You're **not creating new nodes**, just **repointing `.next` pointers**.  
All the work is done **in-place**, except for one dummy node.

ðŸ’¡ Thatâ€™s constant auxiliary space.  
You're not using recursion or allocating a separate list in memory.

---

So:

| Metric            | Complexity |
| ----------------- | ---------- |
| Time              | `O(n + m)` |
| Space (auxiliary) | `O(1)`     |

Let me know if you want the recursive version too â€” it has a different space complexity
